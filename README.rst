A website to visualize your personality using graphs and compare it 
with others. It asks you a
series of questions and analyzes your inputs to create an easy to understand 
graph. It also provides you an
easy way to share these results with your peers and compare your personalities.
It is based on the 
OCEAN_ personality model which is the most acceptable model to measure 
personality used by researchers.

What this website does
======================

First Steps
-----------

After logging in (or signing up), you're guided to take a small
test and asked some questions. Based on your answers, a graph is
generated. This graph tell you where you stand according to the
OCEAN_ personality model, along with a description of what each
attribute means.

Completing your profile
-----------------------

After completing the test, it's recommended that you complete your
profile and fill in other information about yourself like your `bio`, 
`email`, `country`, `gender` etc. This will help us to categorize
your answers better.

Inviting some peers to the scene
--------------------------------

Peers are anyone you know- family, friends, relatives, co-workers, bosses and
acquaintance. You can ask them to attempt a test and try to guess your
personality. To do this, go to the results page (accessed from the dropdown
option `Discover`) and select a test you would like them to attempt
against.
